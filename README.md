Complaints Dashboard is the insight of the consumer complaints submitted to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CPFB).  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is a U.S. government agency that monitors all the consumer complaints and makes sure financial companies treat us fairly.


97% of consumer complaints receive a response from the company. Companies have five options to choose from:

1. Complaint “closed with explanation.” - Seventy-two percent of company responses fall into this category. For example, a consumer who submitted a complaint against a credit card issuer because he was denied a credit line increase might receive a written explanation that outlines why his request was not approved.

2.   Complaint “closed with monetary relief.”  - This means the offending company sent a “measureable” dollar amount to the consumer. Monetary relief includes things like refunding a penalty fee.

3.  Complaint “closed with non-monetary relief.” -  Examples of non-monetary relief include things like correcting credit report errors, changing the terms of an account or ceasing debt collection calls.

4.  “Closed.” -The company closed the complaint without any relief or explanation.

5.  “In-progress.” -   This means the company is reviewing the complaint but cannot respond within 15 days of receiving it. (CFPB expects complaints to be resolved within 60 calendar days.)


6.  Untimely response: If the company does not meet the 15-day deadline to respond to a complaint, the CFPB will mark it as “untimely.”


Complaints by company lists the companies sorted with the highest number of total complaints received. The pie charts displays the company's responses to the different consumers . The maps show the number of complaints spread all across the united states of america. Also, the complaints are show with respect to each month it has received it. Last chart shows the complaints with different types of issues. Each chart can be selected to filter the data with respect to state, company, issue , time and type. The chart can also filter the open and closed complaints with respect to the company's response to the consumer. The dashboard is made to throw significants insights into the amount and type of the complaints received each year.
